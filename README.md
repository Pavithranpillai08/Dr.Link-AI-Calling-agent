2. Enhance the agent to act as a **personal assistant**, giving reminders and helping doctors manage patients.  
3. Integrate **WhatsApp notifications** for a smoother process.  
4. Add **multilingual support** so that every Indian can access it easily. *(Currently, the agent understands only English.)*
